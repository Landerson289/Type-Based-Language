# Type-Based-Language
This language is interpretted by python.

## Syntax
To declare a variable, first use the 'new' command.

    new typeName @variableName

To assign a value to the variable, use the 'set to' command.

    set @variable name to value

To create a new type, use the create command.

    create typeName () {...}

'void' is used when the type of the variable/method is unknown. This is different to null
